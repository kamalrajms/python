    python ?

    high level language
    interperted -- line by  line execution
    dynamic typed -- no need to declare variables types
    exetensive liberies -- numpy,pandas,Djanjo
    versitile -- used in AI,ML,Automation,data science....

## operators type

    Arithmetic , assignement,comparsion or relational,
    logical,membership,bitwise operators

    Arithmetic 

        +,-,*,/,%,**,//
    
    assignement
        =
        +=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=,//=,

    Comparison operatior

        ==,!=,>=,<=,<,>
    
    logical operatior
     
        &&,||,!

        && and
            t f=f
            f t=f
            f f=f
            t t=t
        
        || or

            t f=t
            f t=t
            f f=f
            t t=t
        ! not

            t=f
            f=t

membership operatior

    in   , not in   

bitwise operators

    &-and ,|-or ,^ - xor, ~ - not

##conditional statements

    if,else,elif
    nested

    syntex:

    if condition:
        //code
    elif condition:
        //code
    else:
        //code

## loop

    a loops allowes you to execute a block of code repeatedly as log as a conditonal is true.

    for loop -- used to iterate over a sequence (list,string,rande)
        syntex

            for variableName in sequence:
                //code

    while loop -- runs until acondition become false.

        syntex

            while condition:
                //code

## break,continue statement

    break-- used to exit the loop immediatly ,even if the condition is till true.

    continue-- used to skip the rest of code in the current loop interation 
    and conndition with the next one.

## else block with loop

    The else part executes only if the loop is not broken  using break.

## nested for
